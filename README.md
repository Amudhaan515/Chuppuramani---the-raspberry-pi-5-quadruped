## The mini project - CHUPPURAMANI - the mini quadruped using Raspberry pi 5

# Components used:
-> Raspberry pi 5
-> 3d printed body
-> 12 * Mg90s 
-> 1  * PCA 9685 motor driver
-> 1  * Power supply for the motors (a 11.1 v stack would suffice)
-> 1  * Power supply for Raspberry pi 
-> 1  * Buck converter
-> 1  * multimeter
some screws(probably m3s) and other "engineering stuff".Make sure the servos have their horns.

# Step 1:
Buy all the neccessary components.

# Step-2:
Setup your pi.
There are several useful youtube links from which it can be done but I would prefer Raspberry Pi Tutorial for Complete Beginners by Robotics Backend channel : Here's a link to the playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLSegLrePWgLzBgQqDJvgZ4ewbpCnuare

# Step-3:
3d print the chassis.It is basically a drone(quadcopter)'s body modified to be a quadruped. make sure you do it with enough infill.(35-40 % would suffice)

# Step-4 
Assemble the robot chassis.

# Step-5
Load up the thonny editor from your pi to run the servotest.py program.

# Step - 6
Assemble all the parts and use the robot control.py to control the robot from your computer.
